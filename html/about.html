        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born on 29th of June in 1998 in Belgrade, Serbia. Since my
          childhood I always loved computers and playing video games. That is
          how my interest grew for IT world. Right now, I'm finishing High
          School of electrical engineering and computing in Belgrade. I enjoy
          Web development. It wasn't something I liked in beginning, but it grew
          on me during studying. I'm on a mission to become a Full Stack Web
          Developer.
        </p>


        <p>
          Apart from Web Development, music is my passion. I play guitar and
          produce music for quite sometime. Some of my other hobbies include
          fitness and reading books.
