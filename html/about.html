        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born on the 29th of June in 1998 in Belgrade, Serbia. Since my
          childhood, I always loved computers and playing video games. That's
          how my interest in the IT world started. I will soon graduate from the
          School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Academy of
          Technical and Art Applied Studies, in Belgrade, Serbia. In terms of
          professional interests, I enjoy Web development. It wasn't something I
          liked at first, but it grew on me throughout my studies. My goal is to
          become a Full Stack Web Developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from Web development, music is my passion. I've played guitar
          and produced music for quite some time now. Some of my other hobbies
          include fitness and reading.
